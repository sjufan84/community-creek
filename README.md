# Community Creek
Digital garden for local resilience: help neighbors find and share food, tools, shelter, and skills before turning to distant platforms.

## How to Play the Relay
- Read `product/prompt-contract.md` for mission, guardrails, and success signals.
- Pick one item from `product/backlog.md` (or add your own).
- Do a timeboxed turn (aim for one end-to-end slice).
- Write a handoff note in `notes/handoffs/` using `TEMPLATE.md`.

## Repo Map
- `src/` – Next.js app.
- `prisma/` – data models (User, Resource).
- `product/` – prompt contract and backlog.
- `notes/handoffs/` – turn-by-turn handoff notes.
- `design/`, `experiments/`, `infra/`, `contracts/` – parking lots for future agents.

Run locally: `npm install` then `npm run dev`.
